        <p>
          My name is Ida, and I was born in the early 90's. Ever since I was old
          enough to operate a computer, I have been fascinated with everything
          it can do. I've spent many hours in front of a computer monitor,
          either writing, playing games, researching all the things I've been
          interested in learning about, or designing and developing web sites.
          Until 2021, web development and design was merely a hobby I turned to
          every now and again, mainly in putting together a new written role
          playing concept that I could enjoy with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent parts of my twenties studying to become a teacher, and after I
          was finished I taught a few years before I had my first child. While
          on maternity leave, I thought about if I really wanted to be a teacher
          for the rest of my life, and I started looking into what else I could
          do with my life in case I decided against teaching. I discovered a
          part time online study programme for Front End Development, and it
          intrigued me immediately. I enrolled in March 2021, and am hopefully
          finished with my studies by March 2025.
